## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [create-next-app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your machine

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/vednp/promptopia_project.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory

    ```
    cd promptopia_project
    ```

3. Install the project dependencies

    ```
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
    ```

4. Run the development server

    ```
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or
    bun dev
    ```

After running the development server, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [next/font](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
